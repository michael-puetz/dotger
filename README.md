# Dotger

## Description 

A casual game written in Java with a Swing GUI. I developed this game while preparing for the OCA and OCP exams. 

## Gameplay 

The player controls a little dot and tries to survive as long as possible. There are different objects spawning. The ones described can be collected for extra lives, a party, etc. and the normal round objects hurt or kill the player.
